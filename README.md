Example Voting App
=========

A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

Getting started
---------------
Install below tools:
1. kubectl  : https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#minikube
2. container or virtual machine manager such as Docker or VirtualBox
3. minikube:  https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

Architecture
-----

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)
* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) or [ASP.NET Core](/vote/dotnet) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) or [NATS](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats/) queue which collects new votes
* A [.NET Core](/worker/src/Worker), [Java](/worker/src/main) or [.NET Core 2.1](/worker/dotnet) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) or [TiDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockersamples/tidb/tags/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](/result) or [ASP.NET Core SignalR](/result/dotnet) webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

Assumptions
-----
- Above application is deployed and built into docker images and pushed to docker repository like DockerHub, so that Kuberenetes can pull the image down
- Set up a single node cluster with minikube and start the cluster: 
```
minikube start
```
-  Clone the k8Deploy folder in local

Run the app in Kubernetes
-------------------------
The folder k8Deploy contains the yaml specifications of the Voting App's services in 2-ways:
1. Using Pods
2. Uisng Deployments <br />

- Run the following command to create the Pods and Services objects:
```
$ kubectl create -f k8Deploy/VotingAppUsingPods
$ kubectl create -f k8Deploy/VotingAppServices

```
- Run the following command to create the Deployments and Services objects:
```
$ kubectl create -f k8Deploy/VotingAppUsingDeployment
$ kubectl create -f k8Deploy/VotingAppServices

```
The vote interface is then available on port 30004 on each host of the cluster, the result one is available on port 30005. <br />
You can access the services using the URL which could be formed by IP of minikube or run the cmd
```
minikube service <service_name> --url
```
You can also scale up the deployment and if you refresh the page, each time you will get different page served by a new pod
```
kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=<number>
kubectl scale deployment voting-app-deploy --replicas=4
```
Note
----

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.
